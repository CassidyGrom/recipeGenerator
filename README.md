# Whats in your fridge? A recipe generator to reduce food waste.

American households waste up to 30% of the food they purchase. Our app aims to solve this problem.

The Recipe Generator allows you to input ingredients in your fridge, and it generates a list of recipes that include that item. Like what you see? Click on it to read the recipe and save it for later in your dashboard.

Need one more ingredient or spice to add the finishing touch? Search for a local grocery store.
