# Whats in your fridge? A recipe generator to reduce food waste.
American households waste up to 30% of the food they purchase. Our app aims to solve this problem. 

The Receipe Generator allows you to input ingredients in your fridge and generate a list of recipes that include that item. Like what you see? Click on it to read the recipe and save it for later in your dashboard.
